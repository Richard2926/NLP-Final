# Running pretrained models

If you want to try out our BERT or GPT-2 models then we have specific scripts for trying those out!

For our BERT joke classifier navigate to `./models/BERT` and checkout the README.md for the installs.  The script is `testBERT.py`.

For our GPT joke generator navigate to `./models/GPT` and checkout the README.md for the installs.  The script is `testGPT.py`.

With these scripts you can try giving BERT some sentences to classify as jokes or not and you can prompt GPT with some inputs that
it should turn into a joke by continuing.
