# Testing the BERT model on new jokes

If you want to run our existing BERT model on new jokes make sure you have the latest version of pytorch, tensorflow, and huggingface transformers

```
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
pip install --upgrade pytorch
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
```

Then you can run our testBERT.py program

```
python testBERT.py
```

Have fun seeing if a machine learn model finds your jokes funny or not!
